Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to develop a data-driven strategy to improve user
engagement and conversion rates on the EduFund platform, with a focus on encouraging users
to create goals and invest (App link: https://onelink.to/edufund). As access to real platform

Create a synthetic dataset that simulates user behavior and characteristics, based on your
knowledge and assumptions.
Create a data dictionary to document the variables in the synthetic dataset.

Task 2: Data Analysis and Modeling
Analyze the synthetic data to uncover insights about simulated user behavior.
Develop predictive models to identify users likely to create goals and invest.
Use appropriate metrics to evaluate model performance.

Task 3: Strategy Development
Create a strategy based on model results for targeting users more likely to create goals and
invest.

Task 4: Reporting and Presentation
Prepare a concise report summarizing key findings and the strategy.
Create a presentation for sharing insights and strategy with relevant teams.

Deliverables:
Data dictionary for the synthetic dataset.
Model(s) for predicting user behavior using the synthetic data.
Data-driven strategy document.
Presentation slides for sharing insights and strategy.

Assessment Criteria:
You will be evaluated on the quality of your data analysis, the effectiveness of your strategy, and
your ability to communicate findings and recommendations.
